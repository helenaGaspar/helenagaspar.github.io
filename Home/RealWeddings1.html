        <h3>two architects getting married</h3>
        <p>For us the venue was just so incredibly beautiful that we didn’t really need to put much effort into decorations or any ‘theme.’ It was an old monastery refurbished by the famous Portuguese Architect Eduardo Souto de Moura whose work we both really admire. The attention to detail in the building is flawless. What was real special was that everyone made an enormous effort to come out to Portugal for the weekend and took the opportunity to have a summer holidays out of it. It meant we managed to catch up a little with everyone throughout the week which made the wedding day that more relaxed!</p>
