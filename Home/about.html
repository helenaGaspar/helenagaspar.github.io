        <h2>Pousada Mosteiro de Amares</h2>
        <h3>Get to know us better!</h3>
        <p>Pousada de Santa Maria do Bouro, more commonly known as Pousada Mosteiro de Amares is a Small Luxury Hotel. The hotel’s discreet luxury makes it a perfect place to enjoy a quiet retreat, a wonderful weekend with family or an intimate destination wedding . It is located in Amares, between the city of Braga and the Gerês National Park.</p> 
        
        <p>The Pousada is the result of the remarkable  restoration of a Cistercian Monastery from the 12th century, a work of distinguished architect, Eduardo Souto de Moura, winner of the 2011 Pritzker Prize, the most important worldwide architecture prize. Enveloped by the most fascinating scenery, these is the perfect venue to host your special celebration.</p>
        
        <p>The Mosteiro de Santa Maria de Bouro was first inhabited by monks in 1180 and quickly became rich as a result of royal protection. The monarch protected the religious community of Bouro at the end of the 16th century.  The hermits that lived here from the time of Dom Afonso Henriques had access to farming and pasture areas, abundant water and with the establishment of the Cistercian Order, art and enough ingenuity to be self-sufficient. After the extinction of religious orders, a midwife set up shop in a part of the monastery and many children were born here. And now,  the 32 cells were transformed into comfortable rooms, adapting them to the level of comfort required of modern luxury hotel rooms. </p>
