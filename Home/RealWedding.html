        <h3>intimate wedding</h3>
        <p>We had an intimate wedding in the beautiful Pousada Santa Maria do Bouro in Amares, a 12th century monastery. We felt at peace once we found it. Everything fell into place after that. We wanted to let the natural beauty of the place speak for itself so we had minimal decor. Our vision for the wedding was a simple we wanted gather in Pousada Mosteiro de Amares, family, old friends, new friends, to taste the best Portugal has to offer while we said my vows. It was the best day and our hearts were whole.</p>
